# Dactyl Default Configuration

## Changelog

* Nov 2017:
  * Copied and adapted from the Ergodox EZ equivalent
  * Notable differences:
    - Don't try to have the columns that don't exist, naturally
    - Removed RGB keys, since there are no RGB LEDs in the Dactyl (as designed, at least)

# Dactyl Dvorak keymap

Modifiers and layers 1+ are the same as in the default layout.
Only the layer-0 dvorak-relevant keys are different.
